This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

# Project Summary:
Advanced Next.js Authentication and Dashboard System

This project demonstrates a sophisticated implementation of a modern web application using cutting-edge technologies and best practices in the React and Next.js ecosystem. The application features a robust authentication system, a dynamic dashboard with role-based access control, and a scalable architecture for managing complex data relationships.

Key Technologies and Concepts:

## Next.js 14 (App Router):<br>
  1. Leveraged the latest Next.js features for optimal performance and developer experience.
  2. Implemented server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for improved SEO and faster load times.
  3. Utilized Next.js API routes for serverless backend functionality.

## React 18: <br>
  1. Developed reusable and performant functional components.
  2. Implemented advanced hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) for efficient state management and side effects.
  3. Utilized context API for global state management.

## TypeScript: <br>
  1. Employed strong typing throughout the application for improved code quality and developer experience.
  2. Created custom type definitions for enhanced type safety and autocompletion.

## Authentication<br>
  1. Integrated NextAuth.js for secure, JWT-based authentication.
  3. Developed protected routes and server-side session validation.

## Database Management:<br>
  1. Utilized Prisma ORM for type-safe database queries and migrations.
  2. Designed and implemented a scalable database schema with complex relationships.
  3. Integrated with SQLite for development and easy transition to production databases.

## API Development:<br>
  1. Created RESTful API endpoints using Next.js API routes.
  2. Implemented proper error handling and status codes for robust API responses.

## UI/UX Design:<br>
  1. Integrated shadcn/ui for a modern, accessible component library.
  2. Implemented responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility.
  3. Utilized Tailwind CSS for efficient and maintainable styling.

## State Management:<br>
  1. Implemented complex state management using React hooks and context API.
  2. Developed custom hooks for reusable logic and state management.

## Performance Optimization:<br>
  1. Utilized Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization.

## Security:<br>
  1. Implemented secure password hashing using bcrypt.
  2. Developed CSRF protection and secure session management.
  3. Utilized environment variables for secure configuration management.
